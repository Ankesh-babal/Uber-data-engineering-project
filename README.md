# Uber-data-engineering-project
## Introduction
This project focuses on performing data analytics on Uber trip data using a modern cloud-based technology stack. The workflow involves storing data in GCP Storage, processing and analyzing it with Python on Compute Instances, and managing data pipelines using the Mage Data Pipeline Tool. The data is loaded into BigQuery for advanced querying and analysis, and visualized using Looker Studio for actionable insights. This end-to-end pipeline demonstrates scalable, efficient, and insightful data analytics solutions.
